`Viewer` is a simple tool to view web page source code with Syntax-Highlighted.

#### You can view web page source code with the following ways:

+ Enter web page URL in *Viewer App*;
+ **Share Extension**: Click the Action button at the bottom of your browser ( *Safari* etc. ), select Viewer item in the popup view (action sheet), then switch to *Viewer App*;
+ **Action Extension**:  Click the Action button at the bottom of your browser ( *Safari* etc. ), directly view web page source code in *Safari*.

`Viewer` is very easy to use, you can simply copy any URL, and then switch to Viewer, wait until it finishes loading, it will automatically complete the whole process for you.

#### Easter Egg

Copy a pictureâ€™s Share URL in *Instagram App*, and switch to *Viewer App*. After finishing loading, you can long-press the picture or tap the top-right Action button to save the picture to Albums.

#### Todo

+ Search with Syntax-Highlighted
+ URL detection (use 3D Touch to preview links?[PeekPop](https://github.com/marmelroy/PeekPop))
